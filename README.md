# StudStop
In recent times, online usage has been increased to a new level. Students particularly have started a new phase of e-learning. From classes to exams, everything has become online. Following the trend, we are developing an online library application called StudStop.

In this application, a student or a librarian can signup and login with their credentials. When students log into the application, they can browse through the library and add books of their choice to the cart. Then the students can checkout and pay the desirable amount to buy/rent those books. Once the order is confirmed, they can check for the availability and book an appointment with the librarian to collect those books.

However, when a librarian logs into the application, he/she can check and validate all the appointments and orders with the students for the day which helps to make sure that the books are ready for the students to collect.
